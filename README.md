# QR_Code-Generator
A QR code generator in Python uses the qrcode library to create QR codes from input data, such as text, URLs, or other types of information. The code typically involves importing the qrcode module, creating an instance of a QRCode object, and then calling the make() or make_image() method to generate the QR code and save or display the image.
